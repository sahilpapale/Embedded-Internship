//On Day 01, They explianed the pin diagram of ATMEGA328P.
//We exercised inbuilt led blink on ardiuno
//Here is the Code:
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); 
  delay(1000);                    
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   
  delay(1000);                      
}
